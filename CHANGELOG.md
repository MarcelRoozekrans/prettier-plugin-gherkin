# CHANGELOG

## [2.0.0] - 2023-08-31

### Prettier 3

Handle prettier 3. Prettier 2 is not compatible with this version as the plugin API did change totally.

Prettier 3 remove plugin auto-detection, so you now need to active the plugin explicitly:

> package.json
```diff
-     "prettier": "^2.0.0",
-     "prettier-plugin-gherkin": "^1.0.0",
+     "prettier": "^3.0.0",
+     "prettier-plugin-gherkin": "^2.0.0",
```

> .prettierrc
```diff
  {
+     "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-gherkin"]
  }
```


### (maybe) remove support for Node 14

(maybe) drop support for node 14: prettier 3 does still support node 14, but it is unmaintained, and [the tests does not pass on node 14 only](https://github.com/mapado/prettier-plugin-gherkin/actions/runs/6030258360/job/16361678638?pr=9). If you are willing to spend some time on this, feel free to open a PR, but I suggest you to migrate to a more recent version of node.
